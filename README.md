# Salty

Portable NaCl-powered encryption

Salty makes it easy to send strongly-encrypted messages with a shared key. It uses <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to">NaCl</a> for encryption and <a href="http://base91.sourceforge.net">basE91</a> for portability.

With Salty, you can encrypt a message as long as 185 characters and the resulting cipher will still fit in a tweet (~277 characters), making it ideal for encrypting tweets or other length-restricted communication. You can use it anywhere, though.
